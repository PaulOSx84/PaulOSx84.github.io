    A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic
    circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling,
    and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. This contrasts with external components
    such as main memory and I/O circuitry,[1] and specialized processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).
    The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged.

    Most modern CPUs are implemented on integrated circuit (IC) microprocessors, with one or more CPUs on a single IC chip.
    Microprocessor chips with multiple CPUs are multi-core processors. The individual physical CPUs, processor cores, can also
    be multithreaded to create additional virtual or logical CPUs.[2]
    An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory, peripheral interfaces, and other components of a computer; such
    integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip (SoC).
